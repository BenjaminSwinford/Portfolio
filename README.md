# Portfolio

This is a working repository of several larger projects that I have completed in school. Currently in progress is a firefighter simulation game that is being developed by
myself and several others for our senior project. The repository for this is found in the URL below, however, as it is currently still in development, my team still has the project
as private. If you wish to see more of this project please let me know at swinforb@oregonstate.edu
